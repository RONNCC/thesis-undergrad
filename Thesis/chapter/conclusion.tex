\chapter{Conclusion}

We introduced intersections and unions to a simple system of session types, and demonstrated how they can be used to refine behavioral specifications of processes. Some aspects that would be important in a full accounting of the system are omitted for simplifying the presentation or are left as future work. For example, integrating an underlying functional language \cite{ToninhoCP13}, adding shared channels \cite{CairesP10,PfenningG15}, or considering asynchronous communication \cite{DeYoungCPT12,PfenningG15,Griffith16phd} are straightforward extensions based on prior work. In addition, it would be very useful to have behavioral polymorphism \cite{CairesPPT13} and abstract types. Their interaction with subtyping, intersections, and unions is an interesting avenue for future work.
