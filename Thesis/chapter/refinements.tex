\chapter{Intersection and Union Types as Refinements}

Recall our definition of process level naturals $\nat$. One can imagine cases where we would like to know more about the exact nature of the natural. For example, if we are using a natural to track the size of a list, we might want to ensure it is non-zero. Sometimes, it might be relevant to track whether we have an even or an odd number. The system we have described so far turns out to be strong enough to describe all these \emph{refinements} as illustrated below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=krill, style=custom]
  type Nat = +{zero : 1, succ : Nat}

  type Pos = +{succ : Nat}
  type Even = +{zero : 1, succ : Odd}
  type Odd = +{succ : Even}
\end{lstlisting}

It is easy to see that $\pos$, $\even$, $\odd$ are all subtypes of $\nat$. We run into a problem when we try to implement the behavior described by these types, however. Consider the $\mathtt{s}$ function, for example, which satisfies many properties: $\nat \lolli \nat$, $\pos \lolli \pos$, $\even \lolli \odd$, $\odd \lolli \even$ etc. Subtyping can be used to combine some of these (e.g.\ $\nat \lolli \pos$ for $\nat \lolli \nat$ and $\pos \lolli \pos$) but it is not expressive enough to combine all properties. An elegant solution is to add intersections to the type system.
