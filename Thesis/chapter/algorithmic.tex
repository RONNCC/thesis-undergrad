\chapter{An Algorithmic System}

In this chapter, we prove that subtyping and type-checking are decidable by designing an algorithm that takes in a (sub)typing judgment and produces true if and only if there is a derivation. It turns out to be easy to convert the subtyping relation we presented in \cref{refinements:subtyping-multi-rules} into an algorithm. For type-checking, we have to design an \emph{algorithmic system} and prove it equivalent to the original. Then, the decidability of the new system will imply decidability of the old.
