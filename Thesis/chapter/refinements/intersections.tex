\section{Intersection Types}

We denote the intersection of two types $A$ and $B$ as $A \intersect B$. A process offers an intersection type if its behavior satisfies both types simultaneously. Using intersections, we can assign the programs introduced in \cref{process-expressions} types specifying all behavioral properties we care about:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=krill, style=custom]
  z : Nat and Even
  s : (Nat -o Nat) and (Even -o Odd) and (Odd -o Even)
  double : (Nat -o Nat) and (Nat -o Even)
\end{lstlisting}

Note that as is usual with intersections, multiple types are assigned to \emph{the same process}. Put differently, we cannot use two different processes or specify two different behaviors to satisfy the different branches of an intersection. This leads to the following typing rule:
$$
  \infer[\intersect\Right]{\typeRecDJ{P}{c}{A \intersect B}}
    {\typeRecDJ{P}{c}{A} & \typeRecDJ{P}{c}{B}}
$$

When we are using a channel on the left that offers an intersection of two types, we know it has to satisfy both properties so we get to pick the one we want:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[\intersect\Left_1]{\typeRecD{\ctx, c : A \intersect B}{\recCtx}{P}{d}{D}}
    {\typeRecD{\ctx, c : A}{\recCtx}{P}{d}{D}}
  \and \infer[\intersect\Left_2]{\typeRecD{\ctx, c : A \intersect B}{\recCtx}{P}{d}{D}}
    {\typeRecD{\ctx, c : B}{\recCtx}{P}{d}{D}}
\end{mathpar}
