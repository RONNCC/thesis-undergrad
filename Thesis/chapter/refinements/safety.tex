\label{refinements:semantics}

At this point, we would prove type safety for the extended system. Unfortunately, applicability of subsumption at any point in the presence of intersections and unions complicates a full analysis. So instead, we will first introduce the algorithmic system, which is better behaved, and establish safety for that system. The equivalence of the algorithmic system to the declarative one will then imply safety for the declarative system.
