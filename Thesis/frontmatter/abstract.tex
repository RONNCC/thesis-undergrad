Prior work has established the logical connection between linear sequent calculus and session-typed message-passing concurrent computation. The basic system was shown to guarantee strong properties such as session fidelity and deadlock freedom. In this thesis, we extend the basic type system with intersection and union types in order to express multiple behavioral properties of processes in a single type. In the presence of equirecursive types and a natural notion of subtyping, the resulting system turns out to be strong enough to statically prove many useful properties. %We prove session fidelity and absence of deadlock and illustrate the expressive power of our system with examples.
We present our system and illustrate its expressive power with examples.
