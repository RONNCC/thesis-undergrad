Review of "Intersections and Unions of Session Types"

The paper adds intersection and union types to a system of session
types. This has been considered before, but the novelty is to express
it within the formalism of the correspondence between session types
and linear logic.

The basic system of process calculus and its session type system is
reviewed, followed by the addition of recursive types and
subtyping. Next, intersection and union types are motivated by
examples based on natural numbers and bit strings, and their typing
rules are presented. This is the new material, and it is clearly
presented and easy to follow. Then subtyping is considered in the
presence of intersection and union types, which leads to the need to
reformulate subtyping as a relation on multisets of types. External
and internal choice are then reformulated as intersections and unions.

The next section presents an algorithm for subtyping, and summarises
the proof of its soundness and completeness with respect to the
declarative definition.

Finally, the paper summarises the proofs of the usual progress and
type preservation theorems, for the language with intersection and
union types.

This is a nice paper, clearly presented and making a clear
contribution to the theory of session types and in particular to the
line of work relating session types and linear logic. It will be a
good contribution to the proceedings of ITRS.
